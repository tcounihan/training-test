# training-test
This file is a test to become familiar with adding a readme file in GITHub that describes aspects of the repository that has been created. In this case it is just a pseudo repository created for training purposes.

``` {r} 
packs <- c('readr', 'dataRetrieval', 'tidyverse', 'lubridate', 'leaflet', 'mapview', 'dplyr', 'xlsx', 'gtools','ggplot2')
lapply(packs, require, character.only = T)```

# This is just a test....


Just a few more edits....
